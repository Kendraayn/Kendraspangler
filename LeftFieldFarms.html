In our first meeting, we discussed the scope of the Creative Brief and the current brand identity.

Left Field Farms<br><br>

Given the importance of health and authenticity to the brand, I wanted to create a design that clearly communicates this intention. The swirls of the milk tied with the grains in the background allow new customers to make the quick and easy connection that this is the healthiest selection among a sea of competing brands. In order to further differentiate the design from neighboring brands, I chose a warm gold color that is rarely used for milk products. This gold color was chosen to further connect the idea of natural grains with the milk. </p>

                                    <h2>Version One</h2>
                                    <p>My original thought process was to use a pastel color palette, in an attempt to stand out compared to other milk carton designs that used much more saturated colors. This didn’t work well on the shelf, and made some of the typography difficult to read.</p>

                                    <h2>Version Two</h2>
                                    <p>By my second attempt, I had switched to orange. This corresponded with the use of grains and very few competing brands used the color at all. This also wouldn’t work, as I later realized the color of the carton could be mistaken as a carton of orange juice. At this point, I also wanted to make the flowing milk seem more realistic and flowy along the carton.</p>
                                    
                                    <span class="image main2"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V3_2P.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                         
                                   
                                   
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Version Three</h2>
                                    <p>At this point, I finalized the primary branding color as gold. This still matched the grains and gave the carton a unique appearance on the shelf, while allowing for enough white and blue (for 2% milk) or red (for whole milk) to signal that it was a milk carton. </p>

									<p>While this was one of the most rewarding projects I’ve done thus far, there are certainly challenges that come to mind. I struggled with some technical issues, such as figuring out how to vectorize the milk, as well as how to integrate the typography and the design elegantly through all four faces of the carton. It helped to get plenty of feedback from my group and professor on how to navigate these issues. This project also began just prior to the start of the pandemic, meaning that we experienced both in-person and remote meetings with Danone. While this was unexpected, I appreciated the experience in both methods of communication. </p>
