                                    <p>Create a fresh creative take on the current Danone milk carton design. Create dyelines for Whole milk and 2% milk using the supplied brief and current dyelines that would recapture the brand identity in a new and interesting way.</p>
                                    
                                    <hr>
                                    
                                    <p>For this case study, our internship team of students worked directly with the creative minds behind Danone, who designed the milk cartons for Left Field Farms. In our first meeting, we discussed the scope of the Creative Brief and the current brand identity. We moved on to creating a visual presentation of personality words that captured the brand.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                                    <p>It quickly became apparent that the brand was heavily focused on authenticity and nutrition. The cows are fed non-GMO feed, which we were encouraged to emphasize in our redesigns. The original branding and typography was also inviting and friendly. I wanted to keep this approach while further emphasizing that the product was non-GMO. </p>
                                    
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/Designer%20Statement.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    <p>In our original competitor research, we also realized that the colors red, white, and blue were very common in the shelf space. For my own redesign, I wanted to avoid excessive use of these colors.</p>

										<h1>Concept Sketches</h1>
									</header>
                                    <p>Moving forward from my Designer’s Statement, I created four concept sketches. I originally liked the idea of milk spilling out of a glass, but quickly moved on to the imagery of dripping milk to take better advantage of all four faces of the carton. The integration of milk and oats would inspire ideas of healthy food choices and a nutritious diet. </p>

                                    <h2>Version One</h2>
                                    <p>My original thought process was to use a pastel color palette, in an attempt to stand out compared to other milk carton designs that used much more saturated colors. This didn’t work well on the shelf, and made some of the typography difficult to read.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V1_W.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V1_2Percent.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V1_Shelf.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Version Two</h2>
                                    <p>By my second attempt, I had switched to orange. This corresponded with the use of grains and very few competing brands used the color at all. This also wouldn’t work, as I later realized the color of the carton could be mistaken as a carton of orange juice. At this point, I also wanted to make the flowing milk seem more realistic and flowy along the carton.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                         <span class="image main3"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V2_2P_Carton.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V3_2P.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/V4_Feedback.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Version Three</h2>
                                    <p>At this point, I finalized the primary branding color as gold. This still matched the grains and gave the carton a unique appearance on the shelf, while allowing for enough white and blue (for 2% milk) or red (for whole milk) to signal that it was a milk carton. </p>

                                    <p>At this point, we had another meeting with the Danone team.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                      <span class="image main"><img src="images/LeftFieldFarms/Feedback.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    <p>The biggest concern expressed by the members of Danone were about the grains integrated into the flowing milk. This may lead consumers to believe it was a plant-based milk. While this was a bit of an emotional struggle to part from my original concept, I felt this was definitely a wise observation I hadn’t thought of before. </p>

									<p>While this was one of the most rewarding projects I’ve done thus far, there are certainly challenges that come to mind. I struggled with some technical issues, such as figuring out how to vectorize the milk, as well as how to integrate the typography and the design elegantly through all four faces of the carton. It helped to get plenty of feedback from my group and professor on how to navigate these issues. This project also began just prior to the start of the pandemic, meaning that we experienced both in-person and remote meetings with Danone. While this was unexpected, I appreciated the experience in both methods of communication. </p>
