                        <p> I downloaded three apps representing my top competitors and analyzed each app through Peter Morville's User Experience Honeycomb model. I then gave each app a cumulative rating based on my personal experience using the app. Below, you can see how I analyzed Memrise.

                                    <p>In addition to my competitor analysis, I created a short survey in order to gauge what my audience might be expecting in a vocabulary app. Three interviewees answered 10 questions.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    <li>What is your age?</li>
                                    <li>What is your current occupation or career goal?</li>
                                        <li>Briefly describe a few of your hobbies or daily routines</li>
                                        <li>Is there anything you currently do, or plan to do in the near future, that you could use a vocabulary application for?</li>
                                        <li>What type of learner are you? (Consider if you are a visual learner, a tactile learner, or an auditory learner.)</li>
                                        <li>What study methods have worked for you in the past? (Do you prefer taking notes, using flashcards, listening to lectures, background noise?)</li>
                                        <li>What features would you want to see in a vocabulary app?</li>
                                        <li>Are you using any apps currently? If so, what do you find useful about these apps?</li>
                                        <li>What factors would make you choose one vocabulary app over another?</li>

                                    <p>As a final step to understand the needs of my interviewees, I created a chart analyzing what they’re Doing, Thinking, and Feeling. This step helps me organize the notes I gathered from each interview, and see the perspective of my audience. </p>

                                    <li>Update onboarding to include a “Skip” option. Further refine onboarding to make the process as enjoyable and informative as possible.</li>
                                    <li>Design an interesting and memorable logo for the splashscreen and mobile icon.</li>
                                       <li>Design rough versions of the remaining features and create a journey. Incorporate a reward system.</li>
                                    <li>Create a higher fidelity prototype to further test how color, text size, images, and symbols can influence information hierarchy. </li>

                                   <ol>
                                    <li><b>Embrace Imperfections</b> <br>
When creating sketches, accept that they will start out unrefined. Don’t over-detail your sketches.
                                        
                                        
</li>   <li><b>Understand your Userbase</b><br>
Select users to test your prototype who you think will use and enjoy the app.

</li>
                                       
                                          <li><b>Be Patient</b><br>
Creating the best possible experience for your users requires doing your research and trying out ideas before even considering moving on to a final version.

</li>
                                       
                                          <li><b>Accept Change</b><br>
Accept criticisms and remember that you are designing for your audience, not yourself.
</li>
                                       
                                       
                                          <li><b>Expand your Horizons</b><br>
When you think you have everything figured out, take a step back and think further on what you can do to improve the user experience. 
</li>

                                    <p>While this was a brief introductory case study, the experience was densely packed with all the necessary fundamentals I will need to excel in user experience design. While it can be intimidating to start case studies such as these with a time crunch, there are a number of important lessons to take away from them. Having a limited amount of time to complete a study means that some details may be left out, but this leads to better organization based on necessity. This can also happen in a real work environment, so it’s beneficial to learn how to gain as much information as possible in what little time you are given. </p>

                                    <p>Following full UX certification after CareerFoundry, I've taken the next steps to bring this portfolio piece to the next level. I've created a series of high-fidelity wireframes with additions based on my collected user research for this project.
