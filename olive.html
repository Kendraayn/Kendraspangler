                                    <h2>Devising the Problem Statement</h2>
									<p>Following my review of the provided design brief, I brainstormed some of the primary problems I would need to address. I devised a problem statement, as well as a solution.</p>
									<ul><p>
                                                    
                                     
                                                    <li>Currently, few apps on the market give equal amounts of focus to mental and physical health in the same app. 
                                                       </li>
                                                    
                                            
                                        
                                                    <li>An app designed for goal-setting will need the rewards to outweigh the time spent working toward those goals.
                                                     </li>
                                                
                                            
                                        
                                                   <li>As indicated in the provided brief, users should be able to customize their experience to suit their individual health needs as much as possible.

                                       <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                                    <p>Our users will <b>need</b> a way to organize and maintain their personal health goals <b>because</b> the stressors of work and home life has made it difficult for our users to stay on top of their health. <b>We will know this to be true when</b> we see users are reporting a greater sense of balance through the use of our app, and are updating their health goals with data. </p>

                                    <h3>Potential Solution</h3>
                                    <p>Because there are so many health & wellness apps already on the market, <b>Olive</b> will need to be a fresh take on features that track diet, exercise, medical data, and mental wellness. Customization that allows the app to respond to specific user needs will aid in this pursuit. This can be done by allowing users to choose options that fit their needs best, while hiding options that no longer apply (for example, a user that marks themselves as vegetarian would want recipes containing meat to be hidden from their page.) </p>

Now that I knew my problem statement, I searched for other apps that may have encountered the same problem. When dealing with a heavily saturated market such as health & wellness applications, I knew competitor analysis was key to differentiating myself. I analyzed two of the most reviewed health apps. </p>

                                    <h2>Surveys & Interviews</h2>
                                    <p>My research into my competitors made me realize there weren’t any prominant apps with a focus on water intake. I decided to create a survey investigating if there was a need for this type of app. From the survey, I determined that a majority of participants don't struggle drinking plain water and did not like the idea of adding taste enhancers to their water, but some participants did want notifications reminders to drink more water as well as the ability to set goals. 
                            
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>After finding there was little interest in an app for water-intake, I wanted to gather more information into the wants and needs of my users. I conducted three remote interviews with the intent of exploring general expectations of Health & Wellness apps, and what features my target audience may find lacking in the health apps they currently use.</p>

                                    <p>After collecting notes from each interview, I created an affinity map for each of my interviewees and organized the data based on Needs, Frustrations, Behaviors & Atttitudes, and interesting Quotes.

                                    <p>While the journal section has come a long way, I feel there are still ways to improve it. Ideally, I will want the journals to allow people to share their progress to friends or other app users. However, I worry that the current design may be confusing to first-time users, and the feature may come off as more work than it is rewarding. I think this section would benefit from more interviews, where I can get a better idea of how users may interact with the feature and how they would like to share their progress with like-minded individuals.</p>

                                    <p>My efforts in creating Olive has taught me that any project I work on will always have room to grow. Work is never truly done, and there is always temptation to continue exploring new heights and try new solutions. However, a hard lesson I’ve learned this year is to let go of perfection in order to finally cross the finish line. The work I put into this project was deeply enriching in my understanding of all that goes into UX design. I’m repeatedly amazed by how much careful design and planning goes into the products and commodities we often take for granted. Work like this reminds me how capable humanity can be when we work systematically to create a more welcoming and accessible world for everyone. </p>
